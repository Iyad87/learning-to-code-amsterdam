## Learn the basics of git

**Why use git:**

Learning programming requires a lot of experimentation. But the feeling that you might break code that you wrote can hold you back from doing that. Luckily there is a great solution that let's you 'turn back time' and it's called git. Version control with git is your camel that let's you explore the desert without fear that you can't get back.

As an added bonus git allows you to collaborate with other programmers. You can merge your version of a program with a version of someone else.

Lastly git allows you to easily save your code in remote repositories hosted in the cloud on platforms like github, gitlab or bitbucket. That way the chance that you permanently lose your work is almost impossible.
