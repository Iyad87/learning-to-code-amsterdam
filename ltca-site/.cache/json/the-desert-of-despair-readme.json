You have a programming project or two like a simple page or a commandline app. You already have some of the professional tools like an editor a programming language and you know how to open your commandline. Now you want to build something meaningful, something that will impress you and your friends.</p>\n<p>The next step is to start using the power of libraries and frameworks. By building on top of the work of more experienced programmers you can build much more impressive software at much faster pace.</p>\n<p>This phase is probably the hardest part of programming because it requires learning many concepts and skills at the same time. Focus on keeping your projects small and doable and don’t be afraid to repeat some steps to get more familiar with what your using and to feel competent. </p>\n<h2><em>How does it work?</em></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>This travel bucketlist has starting off points, tools and challenges</li>\n<li>It up to <em>you</em> to find the solutions ( that’s programming baby! ).</li>\n<li>Use google or ask a neighbour when you get stuck</li>\n<li>Have fun!</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Buy a camel</h3>\n<p><a href=\"/1.buy-a-camel-f00fdf1c6e385783ed85b01265eaabf6.md\">Learn the basics of git</a></p>\n<h3>Do a multi-day desert trek</h3>\n<p><a href=\"./2.multi-day-desert-trek.md\">Use a framework</a></p>\n<h3>Share your desert story</h3>\n<p><a href=\"/3.share-your-desert-story-d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e.md\">Deploy your application</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"","subtitle":null}}},"pathContext":{"slug":"/the-desert-of-despair/README/"}}
