# Take a guided tour

Now that you've chosen a language it's time to get the basics down. I recommend doing a tutorial online. 

This guided tour is best done in combination with [Take some pictures](./6.take-some-pictures.md) to create a cheat sheet for yourself as you're doing the tutorial.

## Resources:

**If you chosen HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Python, Ruby or Java I can recommend:**

[CodeCademy](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/subject/web-development)

It has lightweight tutorials that teach the basic syntax of a programming
language.


**If you've chosen something other, have a look at this list of resources:**
