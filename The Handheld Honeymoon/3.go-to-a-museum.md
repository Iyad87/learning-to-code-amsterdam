# Go to a museum

We are going to try javascript for the first time with Repl.it!  
Repl.it is a an online editor with which you can try out many different programming languages without having to install them.
* Go to https://repl.it/
* In the searchbox (`Search for a language, e.g. c++`) enter `Javascript`
* Use the `run` button to start your program!

### **Challenges:**

**Easy mode**

- [ ] Make a popup appear by using `window.alert('Hello world')`
- [ ] Make some text appear in the console by using `console.log('Your text here')`
- [ ] Do some math: add two numbers together and run your program

**Intermediate**

- [ ] Look up how to declare a variable. Declare a variable and assign it the string 'I am a variable'
- [ ] `console.log` the value of your variable
- [ ] Ask the user for some input using `window.prompt('Can I get some input?')`
- [ ] Assign the result of `window.prompt('Can I get some input?')` to a variable called `userInput`
- [ ] `console.log` the value of `userInput`

**Challenge mode**

- [ ] Ask the user for permission with `window.confirm('Are you sure?')` and assign the result of `window.confirm` to a variable `permission`
- [ ] Log the value of `permission`, what kind of value does it have?
- [ ] Look up how to make a conditional statement (an `if` statement)
- [ ] Use the permission variable and an `if` statement to make your program do two different things depending on wether you got permission from the user.

**Further reading**

- [ ] Look up what datatypes are and what datatypes exist in Javascript
- [ ] Look up what functions are in javascript and how you can use them

You can use the [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp) javascript section as a reference to look things up
